# Pre-requisites and setup

## Pre-requisites

This project is based on `Python3`, `pip` and `venv`.

### Installing Python3 on your Mac. 

On Mac, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) can be used (or download the official installer from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

Run the following command on a terminal:
```
brew install python
```
Check Python installation by getting the Python3 version:
```
python3 --version
```

## Project setup.

### Creating a virtual env with using the Python3 baked module `venv` (optional).
I recommend creating a Virual Env to avoid interfering other Python project on your local (and I consider it a good practice), although it is optional due to it does not impact the behavior of this implementation. For more information please visit [this documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
